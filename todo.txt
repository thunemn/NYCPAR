App Name: NYC Parks & Rec

Overview: NYC Parks & Rec (NYCPAR) allows the user to view hiking trails located inside the NYC area.  The app fetches the trails from the NYC OpenData API and displays them in a list sorted alphabetically.  The user is able to click on any trail and view the details of that trail.  They are also able to 'Favorite' a trail and view their saved favorites from the 'Favorites' tab in the navigation drawer.

Future Implementation: To improve upon the NYCPAR app in the future, the following features could be added:
	-Filter/Search
	-Share a trail
	-More categories (for example, Beaches were available as a static json file but did not satisfy the requirement for client/server demonstration)
	-Dark mode
	-Landscape/Tablet
	-Monetization strategy (ads, promoted content, etc)
